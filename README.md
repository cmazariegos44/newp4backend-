## Project Description

~~My SECOND PROJECT: I will be creating a shopping cart that can add a product to a cart and delete a product from a cart as well as leave reviews on a site~~
- LOL I ended up creating a task app meant to remind you of all of the books sitting on your bookshelf that you have not read yet. It is a very basic app, but in the future I think it would be nice to add a date next to when books are purchased. 

- Tsundoku is the art of buying books and not reading them, so I wanted to create an app that would keep track of all the books ive ever bought before and never read. Its  like a RIP to the books. 


## User Stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?

~~The user goes on this app to online shop~~
The user types in a book they bought and write notes if they completed the book or not.

## Additional Libraries - Resources used 
Used Alex's videos on YouTube and they helped a ton! 

## Code Snippet 

Honestly the whole project is something I am proud of. It is a very basic app but seeing the start to finish was stressful but SO rewarding! I had a lot of fun working through the struggle because it was really all a learning experience!

## Issues and Resolutions BACKEND
- Crud was working perfectly on Heroku and Netlify until I decided to create  a “create user” and modified the models then messed up backend and now front end on netlify won’t work. Because I changed it so last minute it looks like there is an owne_id error :( 

- It works locally but it was nice seeing it on a deployed site
